# Financial Performance Analysis of Kaufland Romania (2017-2023)  

This project presents a detailed analysis of the **financial performance** of **Kaufland Romania** for the period **2017-2023**, utilizing **Microsoft Access, Excel, RStudio, and Crystal Ball** for **data analysis, economic forecasting, and risk simulations**.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Content  
1. **Database Management in Access** â€“ Organizing and managing financial and commercial data of the company.  
2. **Data Analysis and Visualization in Excel** â€“ Creating **Dashboards, Pivot Tables, and Charts** to evaluate financial indicators.  
3. **Econometric Modeling in RStudio**:  
   - Linear regression between expenses and profit.  
   - ARIMA model for revenue forecasting.  
   - Scenario analysis (optimistic/pessimistic).  
4. **Monte Carlo Simulations in Crystal Ball** â€“ Estimating the impact of expense variations on net profit.  

## ðŸ“Š Data Used  
- **Turnover (Revenue)**  
- **Gross & Net Profit**  
- **Total Expenses**  
- **Number of Employees**  
- **Sales by Region and Brand**  

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used  
- **Microsoft Access** for database management.  
- **Excel + Crystal Ball** for financial analysis and risk simulations.  
- **RStudio** for statistical modeling and forecasting.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Conclusions  
- Kaufland recorded **steady revenue and profit growth** between 2017 and 2023.  
- Linear regression showed a **strong correlation** between expenses and profit.  
- The ARIMA model **forecasted consistent revenue growth** over the next five years.  
- Scenario analysis indicated **minimal risks** and **high financial stability**.  
- Monte Carlo simulations showed that **cost optimization** can enhance profitability.  

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Analysis  
1. **Open the `Analiza_RStudio.R` file in RStudio** and run the sections for regression and forecasts.  
2. **Load the database in Access** to explore relationships between data.  
3. **Use Excel and Crystal Ball** for simulations and interactive visualizations.
